VSCode Shortcut
VSCode has a built-in shortcut you can use for generating all the boilerplate in one go. To trigger the shortcut, delete everything 
in the index.html file and just enter ! on the first line. This will bring up a couple of options. Press the enter key to choose the 
first one, and voila, you should have all the boilerplate populated for you.
