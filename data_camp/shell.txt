-c: print a count of matching lines rather than the lines themselves
-h: do not print the names of files when searching multiple files
-i: ignore case (e.g., treat "Regression" and "regression" as matches)
-l: print the names of files that contain matches, not the matches
-n: print line numbers for matching lines
-v: invert the match, i.e., only show lines that don't match


How can I store a command's output in a file?
head -n 5 seasonal/summer.csv > top.csv
The greater-than sign > tells the shell to redirect head's output to a file.
